Code:
-------
Python
-------
Baseline, Oracle, Logistic regression, SVM and random forests (including clustering) for delay prediction and 
cancellation classification were implemented both in python and matlab. The python implementations are run from "regression.py" 
which has "pred_lib.py" as a dependancy. regression.py takes a feature CSV and a result CSV as required inputs. 
A variety of other input flags are available to determine what data is predicted on and which models to use. 
These flags can be further explored by running the following in the command line

"python regression.py -h"

regression.py [-h] [-l] [-o] [-bo] [-p] [-k] [-s] [-b] [-rf] [-c]
                     [-pt PLOT_TITLE] [-t] [-v] [-gt GRID_SEARCH]
                     feature_file result_file

The python models and their results are documented in the following Codalab Worksheet
https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0xdcc653253e0143c4aecc85ea963c9db1/

-------
Matlab
-------
The MATLAB script files each produces a specific set of outputs for Regression and Classification methods for delay prediction 
and Classification for cancellation prediction. Their inputs are "five_airlines_cancels.csv", "five_airlines_delays.csv",
"five_airlines_features.csv" and we parse, normalize and shuffle the data to produce the desired outputs and write them into
different CSV files. Then we use MATLAB simulation apps to produce the results. For neural network fitting part, we extracted the 
code and altered it to satisfy our need for more layers. You can reproduce the results by running "mehrad_neural.m"
"mehrad_som.m", "MSE.m".

Data:
The directory data/processed_data contains the cleaned CSV files used as input to our python models. 
Note that delays and cancellations have seperate feature and result files. These files contain cleaned data for domestic flights 
between the top five airports in terms of traffic for the month of December. Note that these flights are in chronological 
order and features are as reported in the raw set, regression.py does further processing in terms of creating indicator features, shuffling, etc.
