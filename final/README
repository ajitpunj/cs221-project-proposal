Code:
-------
Python
-------
Baseline, Oracle, Logistic regression, SVM and random forests (including clustering) for delay prediction and 
cancellation classification were implemented both in python and matlab. The python implementations are run from "regression.py" 
which has "pred_lib.py" as a dependancy. regression.py takes a feature CSV and a result CSV as required inputs. 
A variety of other input flags are available to determine what data is predicted on and which models to use. 
These flags can be further explored by running the following in the command line

"python regression.py -h"

regression.py [-h] [-l] [-o] [-bo] [-p] [-k] [-s] [-b] [-rf] [-c]
                     [-pt PLOT_TITLE] [-t] [-v] [-gt GRID_SEARCH]

Data:

Note that delays and cancellations have seperate feature and result files. These files contain cleaned data for domestic flights 
between the top five airports in terms of traffic for the month of December. Note that these flights are in chronological 
order and features are as reported in the raw set, regression.py does further processing in terms of creating indicator features, shuffling, etc.
 
-------
processed_data
-------
The directory data/processed_data contains the cleaned CSV files used as input to our python models. 

-------
ND_data
-------
This directory contains the data that is used in the neural network models. This data is all based on the data in processed_data but may be binned or normalized for specific models / use cases.
